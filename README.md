# Python-Data-Cleaning
This project uses Python and pandas to clean and standardise a messy healthcare admissions dataset. It fixes inconsistent date formats, normalises categorical fields (e.g. smoker status), and cleans numeric columns such as BMI and billing amounts so they can be reliably used for analysis, reporting, and downstream modelling.
